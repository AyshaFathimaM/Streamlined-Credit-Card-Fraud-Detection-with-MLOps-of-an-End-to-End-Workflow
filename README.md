## Streamlined Credit Card Fraud Detection with MLOps of an End-to-End Workflow
This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of an MLOps pipeline for credit card fraud detection. It covers the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. A user-friendly Streamlit application is developed to allow real-time predictions, making it easy to identify fraudulent transactions. The pipeline is designed for scalability and efficiency, with robust evaluation ensuring high accuracy and reliability. This project highlights the practical application of machine learning and MLOps to solve real-world problemsÂ effectively.
